# Formulae App

![app icon](app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxxhdpi/ic_launcher_round.webp)

An extremely simple app to write and share formulas, with zero permissions.

We have a two well-defined concepts in this project:

* Simple: the design may be ugly, but the idea is simple, write formulas and get images back (and possibly share)
* Should avoid third party dependencies: only the required androidx dependencies are used
* No ADS: no explanation needed, we all hate ads
